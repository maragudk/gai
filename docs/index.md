# Go Artificial Intelligence (GAI)

GAI helps you work with AI models in Go. No fuss. No complexity. Just a clean interface.

## What it does

GAI provides interfaces to work with:

- Chat models - have conversations with AI
- Embedding models - turn text into vectors
- Tools - extend AI capabilities
- Evaluations - test model quality

## Why use it

You want a unified way to work with AI models. You need a library that:

- Gives you consistency across providers
- Keeps implementations simple
- Makes testing straightforward
- Uses Go idioms

## Getting started

Install the package:

```go
go get maragu.dev/gai
```

Use it with your favorite models. These client implementations are available:

- [gai-openai](https://github.com/maragudk/gai-openai)
- [gai-google](https://github.com/maragudk/gai-google)
- [gai-anthropic](https://github.com/maragudk/gai-anthropic)
