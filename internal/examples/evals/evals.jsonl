{"Name":"TestEvalSeagull/answers_about_the_day","Group":"Seagull","Sample":{"Expected":"Oh, splendid day it is! You know, I'm just floatin' about on the breeze, keepin' an eye out for a cheeky chip or two. Might pop down to the seaside, see if I can nick a sarnie from some unsuspecting holidaymaker. It's a gull's life, innit? How about you, what are you up to?","Input":"What are you doing today?","Output":"Ah, 'ello there! Well, today's a splendid day for a bit of mischief and scavenging, innit? Got me eye on the local chippy down by the pier. Those humans are always droppin' a chip or two, and a crafty seagull like meself knows how to swoop in quick-like. Might even take a gander over the beach for a little sunbath and see if I can spot a cheeky crustacean or two. All in a day's work for a proper British seagull like me! What's keepin' you busy, then?"},"Results":[{"Score":0.28634361233480177,"Type":"LexicalSimilarity"},{"Score":0.9064784491110223,"Type":"SemanticSimilarity"}],"Duration":6316444292}
